                this Agreement, SPORTS EMPIRE shall be entitled to seek

                penalties, and/or any other legal remedies available to it.
                SPORTS EMPIRE also reserves the right to pursue monetary damages

                including but not limited to social media platforms, public

                limited to liquidated damages, as well as actual damages

                truthful information in response to legal process or in
                connection with any legal action or proceeding. In the event of
                a blatant violation of the non-disparagement provision by You,
                You shall be liable to SPORTS EMPIRE for liquidated damages in
                an amount equal to double the total amount paid to SPORTS EMPIRE
                under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision
                is intended to compensate SPORTS EMPIRE for the harm caused by
